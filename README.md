The Spotify Song Popularity Predictor, or SSPP, is a data science project intended to find the best model for predicting song popularity on the Spotify platform, based on a set of features: acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness, valence. The project imports the Spotify dataset and then creates a feature matrix and label vector that can be used with the knn, decision tree, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and kmeans clustering algorithms to find a model that produces the most accurate popularity prediction. With this model, a useful application can be created for musicians, A&R agents, managers, and members of the music industry to measure a songs liklihood, or not, of becoming popular on the Spotify platform, one of the most popular music streaming platforms on the market.
